          <h1>What are Reverse Vending Machines?</h1>
          <p>
            Reverse Vending Machines, also known as RVMs, are automated
            recycling systems that incentivize individuals to recycle by
            offering rewards in exchange for empty containers. These machines
            act as collection points, allowing users to deposit their used
            plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and other recyclable items. RVMs
            promote a circular economy by encouraging responsible waste
            management and resource conservation..

          <h1>The Functionality of Reverse Vending Machines</h1>
          <p>
            RVMs operate on a simple yet effective mechanism. When a user places
            a recyclable item into the machine, it recognizes and sorts it based
            on its material. The machine then provides immediate feedback, such
            as displaying the number of items recycled or issuing a receipt for
            accumulated rewards. Once the containers are deposited, RVMs
            compress and store them for efficient transportation to recycling
            facilities. By streamlining the recycling process, RVMs make it
            convenient and rewarding for individuals to contribute to a cleaner
            and greener Eswatini.

          <h1>Benefits of Reverse Vending Machines</h1>
          <p>
            The adoption of RVMs in Eswatini offers numerous benefits for
            individuals, communities, and the environment. Firstly, RVMs create
            a sense of personal responsibility, empowering individuals to
            actively participate in recycling efforts. Secondly, they contribute
            to the reduction of litter and pollution, preserving the natural
            beauty of our country. Thirdly, RVMs support the local economy by
            promoting a sustainable waste management industry and creating
            employment opportunities. Lastly, RVMs help conserve valuable
            natural resources by recycling materials and reducing the need for
            raw material extraction.
